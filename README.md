## Spotify Sync

(wip)

Listen to the same spotify track your friend is listening to!

### How it (will) work

* UserA links their Spotify account with Spotify Sync
* UserB visits spotifysync.org/sync?user=UserA which presents a Spotify browser player
* Server queries Spotify to check what UserA is listening to so that UserB can stay synced
